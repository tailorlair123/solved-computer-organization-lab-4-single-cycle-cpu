1. GoalTo realize how to set the control signal in different instruction type.( Decoder &amp; ALU Controller)To clarify how sign-extend work.Connect all datapath to form a single cycle CPU2. HW RequirementFinish the truth table for Decoder.Every raw for 3 point. If a raw got any wrong answer, you will not get any point forthat raw.Implement bellow instruction for testing data.addsltaddilwswbeqjaljalrYou would not get any score for this part if your program can’t pass the test byscript.You should fill in name of your directory in all your {*.v} or you will not pass thescript testing.ExperimentWhat’s the problem you encounter?Your implement detail.Anything you want to say.3. Hand inYour hand in structure should like this.{$(groupN)_$(studentid1)_$(studentid2)}.zip{$(groupN)_$(studentid1)_$(studentid2)}$(studientid1)_report.pdf$(studientid2)_report.pdfMakefileInstruction.txt{*.v}Your report should be in PDF format.ReportTruth table for decoder.Experiment.
